# EnviroSocial
EnviroSocial is an innovative social network for sharing real-time environmental data that are collected by our users while riding their bikes. It consists of a mobile environmental device specially designed to fit all bicycles, which can continuously collect data that affect the microclimate of the area, and an android app that can be installed on our smartphones and send the data to a central world map. This way the user can collect data and see in real-time local measurements from all users in the same area and choose the best route to follow. EnviroSocial collects the following measurements:
-   PM 2.5 particles,
-   carbon monoxide concentration,
-   temperature,
-   humidity,
-   and noise levels

Utilizing the sensors on the mobile device and the GPS locator of our smartphone, all data is stored in a central database and shown on the map of our application, filtered by time and area.
## Endorsement
EnviroSocial and Coconut Robotics are endorsed by the Greek Minister of Education Mrs. [Niki Kerameus](https://www.facebook.com/NikiKerameus) who we would like to thank for her full support and promotion.
## Innovative solution
EnviroSocial uses low-cost and widely available sensors and microcontrollers for mobile environmental collectors. With a battery autonomy of 8-9 hours, our devices can provide the network with many measurements in wide geographic locations, as users commute to their everyday activities with their bikes. Our android application can show users in real-time all the data in their area during the last hours, days, weeks, and months. There are a few similar projects in the making around the world that are trying to take advantage of bicycle users for collecting environmental data, but none of them offers a real-time interface through a smartphone application.
## Impact
The core of our system is a new social network where users will not only benefit from the available data but will also contribute their own measurements. The engagement of the broader public in the system has also the dynamic to raise awareness for climate change and the local environmental conditions in the communities we live in.
## Sustainability
The PCB design of our environmental collectors allows for an easy replacement and upgrading of its components, making our system more durable and sustainable, limiting the exploitation of resources for their manufacturing and maintenance. Furthermore, the prototyping of the container of the device is using recycled PLA material which can also be used in mass production.
## Alignment with UN’s Sustainable Development Goals
EnviroSocial is aligned with three of the UN’s Sustainable Goals

-   It promotes well-being and a healthy way of living for all people of all ages, endorsing the bicycle as a main way of commuting and allowing bikers to choose routes that have less air pollution.
-   It contributes to making cities inclusive, safer from pollution, resilient, and sustainable, allowing at the same time people to have real-time monitoring of the micro-climate conditions in them.
-   It is at its core a social network for the environment with the dynamic to raise awareness for issues concerning the environmental conditions in our communities and climate change.
